        <h1>Hi! My name is Tremaine Trotter!</h1>
        <h2>I am a Front End Web Developer specializing in responsive, accessible, and engaging interactive websites.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div>
          <p>I was always interested in computers, the World Wide Web, and the websites that existed there.
            <br>
            <br>
            I decided to go into web development because I have always been interested in HOW websites were created and
            imagined creating my own but, as a child, I had convinced myself that creating such spaces was beyond me.
            What
            wizardry went into making them, how were they always there, and how were the websites maintained/ changed?
            Back then, I assumed it was all magic and left it at that. But that interest would remain.
            <br>
            <br>
            After discovering a career in fashion design was NOT for me, learning how to build computers from scratch,
            and
            deciding on a second career change, I decided to try coding to see what magic I could create and share. I am
            glad I took the plunge! I truly enjoy the ups and downs of becoming and being a web developer and look
            forward
            to learning more of the coding languages and finally creating spaces of my own on the World Wide Web.
            <br>
            <br>
            When I’m not working or coding, I’m most likely playing my favorite game and current obsession, Final
            Fantasy
            XIV. I also love reading, journaling, and exploring new music.
