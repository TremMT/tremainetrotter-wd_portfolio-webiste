        <p>
          Hi there, 

          I was always interested in computers, the World Wide Web, and the websites that existed there.

          I decided to go into web development because I have always been interested in HOW websites were created and imagined creating my own but, as a child, had convinced myself that creating such spaces was beyond me. What wizardry went into making them, how were they always there, and how they were maintained/ changed? Back then, I assumed it was all magic and left it at that. But that interest would remain.

          After discovering a career in fashion design was not for me, learning how to build computers from scratch, and
          deciding on a second career change, I decided to try coding to see what magic I could create and share. I'm
          glad I took the plunge!

          When I’m not working or coding, I’m most likely playing my favorite game and current obsession, Final Fantasy
          XIV. I also love reading, journaling, and exploring new music.
